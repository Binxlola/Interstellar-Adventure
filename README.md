## About

**Interstellar Adventures** was originally a university project, in which students were asked to create basic GUI adventure game.
The theme of the game is that a crew are stranded somewhere in space as their ship has lost some of it's parts during it's hyper jump. The player is given a set time to explore the planets around them in search of these parts. The also required that there be an implementation of an inventory and a in-game shop. The guidelines for the project stated that students implement some form of random event, in this case the game as alien attacks, space plauge, and space obstructions.

## Future plans

Personally I had a great deal of fun working on this project. This is why I plan to continue development on the project, enchance the inventory and shop experience. While adding a few more engaging features, such as ship battles and alien brawls where the player is able to make desicions that will help define the outcome of the event. The game could also do with some work on it's visual appeal with some images and art work.
