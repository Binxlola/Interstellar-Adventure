## About

**Interstellar Adventures** Was originally a university project, in which students were asked to create basic GUI adventure game.
The theme of the game is that a crew are stranded somewhere in space as their ship has lost some of it's parts during it's hyper jump. The player is given a set time to explore the planets around them in search of these parts. The also required that there be an implementation of an inventory and a in-game shop. The guidelines for the project stated that students implement some form of random event, in this case the game as alien attacks, space plauge, and space obstructions.
